# Decision making

## Purpose

The purpose of this document is to outline rules for decision making
that will facilitate the broad acceptance of the file format proposed
herein, and/or broad community-based agreement on other format(s) to be
broadly used. The goal of of the process is to reach consensus among
as large as possible a group of stakeholders, such that decisions
taken here are likely to affect the desired changes in practice.

## The community

The target community of this decision making process and the outcomes of this
purpose are researchers who use tractography in their research, as well as
developers of software the produces or consumes tractography results.

## Reaching consensus

The first step to reach consensus would be to survey the community. This
would reduce the barrier to entry to express an opinion about. We would
assume that participants engage in good faith (i.e., not reply multiple
times to the survey or engage in excessive lobbying). This will be an
opportunity for stakeholders to express preference, and also offer
alternatives to the courses of action currently envisioned.

## Potential courses of action

These are based on the presentation that @frheault gave on December 2nd, 2020
at the DIPY open community meeting.

### Broadly adopt TCK

### Broadly adopt TRAKO

### Develop new TRX format
